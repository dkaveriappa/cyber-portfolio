# LetsDefend Cybersecurity for Students – Networking Fundamentals

## 🎯 Objective
Understand the basics of networking, including TCP/IP layers, common protocols, and how they relate to cybersecurity defense and monitoring.

---

## 📝 Steps Taken
1. Reviewed the OSI vs TCP/IP models.  
2. Learned about key protocols (DNS, HTTP/S, FTP, SMTP, ICMP).  
3. Explored how attackers may exploit these protocols.  
4. Completed practice questions and examples inside LetsDefend.

## 🔑 Key Takeaways
- The **TCP/IP model** is simpler (4 layers) vs. OSI (7 layers) but both map to real-world troubleshooting.  
- Many **cyber attacks exploit protocols** (e.g., DNS tunneling, ICMP floods, SMTP phishing).  
- Understanding normal protocol behavior is critical before detecting anomalies in SOC.  
- Networking knowledge = foundation for **log analysis & packet inspection** in SIEM/Wireshark.
